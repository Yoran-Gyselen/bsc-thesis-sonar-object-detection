  abstract    = {With the growing interest in underwater exploration and monitoring, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have become essential. The recent interest in onboard Deep Learning (DL) has advanced real-time environmental interaction capabilities relying on efficient and accurate vision-based DL models. However, the predominant use of sonar in underwater environments, characterized by limited training data and inherent noise, poses challenges to model robustness. This autonomy improvement raises safety concerns for deploying such models during underwater operations, potentially leading to hazardous situations. This paper aims to provide the first comprehensive overview of sonar-based DL under the scope of robustness. It studies sonar-based DL perception task models, such as classification, object detection, segmentation, and SLAM. Furthermore, the paper systematizes sonar-based state-of-the-art datasets, simulators, and robustness methods such as neural network verification, out-of-distribution, and adversarial attacks. This paper highlights the lack of robustness in sonar-based DL research and suggests future research pathways, notably establishing a baseline sonar-based dataset and bridging the simulation-to-reality gap.},

  abstract    = {This paper introduces ROSAR, a novel framework enhancing the robustness of deep learning object detection models tailored for side-scan sonar (SSS) images, generated by autonomous underwater vehicles using sonar sensors. By extending our prior work on knowledge distillation (KD), this framework integrates KD with adversarial retraining to address the dual challenges of model efficiency and robustness against SSS noises. We introduce three novel, publicly available SSS datasets, capturing different sonar setups and noise conditions. We propose and formalize two SSS safety properties and utilize them to generate adversarial datasets for retraining. Through a comparative analysis of projected gradient descent (PGD) and patch-based adversarial attacks, ROSAR demonstrates significant improvements in model robustness and detection accuracy under SSS-specific conditions, enhancing the model's robustness by up to 1.85\%. ROSAR is available at https://github.com/remaro-network/ROSAR-framework.},

SubPipe has been recorded using a \gls{LAUV}, operated by OceanScan MST, and carrying a sensor suite including two cameras, a side-scan sonar, and an inertial navigation system, among other sensors. The AUV has been deployed in a pipeline inspection environment with a submarine pipe partially covered by sand. The AUV's pose ground truth is estimated from the navigation sensors. The side-scan sonar and RGB images include object detection and segmentation annotations, respectively. State-of-the-art segmentation, object detection, and SLAM methods are benchmarked on SubPipe to demonstrate the dataset's challenges and opportunities for leveraging computer vision algorithms. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first annotated underwater dataset providing a real pipeline inspection scenario.
